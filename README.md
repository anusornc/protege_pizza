| Ontologies     | Each is a "view" of the business world (and business information) that is required to meet a specific business need |
| Business Rules | Atomic units of logic that govern behavior of concepts and relationships                                            |
| Relationships  | Other business relationships outside taxonomies and hierarchies                                                     |
| Hierarchies    | How individual things (instances) are associated at multiple levels for specific businees needs                     |
| Taxonimies     | The relationships of general with specific concepts                                                                 |

| Terms          | The specialized terms used in the business, with homonyms, synonyms, and universes of discourse identified          |

## Learn Ontologies from pizza.owl

Thanks for Michael DeBellis's great tutorial on pizza.owl, which is helping to understand the key concepts of ontology and also a way of building practices.

This repository is tracking my hands-on modeling the pizza.owl in step-by-step manner, and you can find the snapshot ontology model files in every step so that you can start your practice from any point.

## Why Protégé?

![protege-logo](img/protege_logo.png)

Check [Protege Website](https://protege.stanford.edu/), you can find below statements:

*Protégé’s plug-in architecture can be adapted to build both simple and complex ontology-based applications. Developers can integrate the output of Protégé with rule systems or other problem solvers to construct a wide range of intelligent systems. Most important, the Stanford team and the vast Protégé community are here to help.*

I'm using Protégé to learn pizza.owl and also practice the modeling skill here.

Some reference quick link about Protégé:

- [WebProtégé](http://webprotege.stanford.edu/)
- [Download Windows Version 5.6.1](https://protege.stanford.edu/software.php), also have Java package for platform independent installating.
- [Protégé wiki](https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Main_Page)
- [Protégé in Github](https://github.com/protegeproject), from here you can get latest version
